## Script for copying low level discovery rules (LLD Discovery) in Zabbix

The simplest possible script which uses [discoveryrule.copy](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/6.0/en/manual/api/reference/discoveryrule/copy) API call. 

All configuration should be done by editing script sources. 

And please vote for implementing it in the Zabbix GUI here: https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBXNEXT-1221
